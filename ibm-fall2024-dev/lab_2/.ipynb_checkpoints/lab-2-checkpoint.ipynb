    "Transpilation is the process of rewriting a given input circuit to an equivalent circuit for a specific quantum device, and/or to optimize the circuit for execution on a real quantum systems, in terms of basis gate set, topology of the quantum chips and timing constraints, etc. The goal of a transpiler is to get the best performance from a noisy quantum hardware so most circuits must undergo a series of transformations that make them compatible with a given target device, and optimize them to reduce the effects of noise on the resulting outcomes. \n",

    "A central component of the Qiskit SDK, the transpiler is designed for modularity and extensibility. Its main goal is to write new circuit transformations (known as transpiler passes), and combine them with other existing passes, greatly reducing the depth and complexity of quantum circuits. Which passes are chained together and in which order has a major effect on the final outcome. This pipeline is determined by the [PassManager](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.PassManager) and [StagedPassManager](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.StagedPassManager) objects. The `StagedPassManager` orchestrates the execution of one or more `PassManagers` and determines the order in which they are executed, while the `PassManager` object is merely a collection of one or more passes. Think of the `StagedPassManager` as the conductor in an orchestra, the `PassManagers` as the different instrument sections, and the `Pass` objects as the individual musicians. In this way, you can compose hardware-efficient quantum circuits that let you execute utility-scale work while keeping noise manageable."

Create a pass manager by initializing a [PassManager](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.PassManager) with a list of transpiler passes. To run the transpilation on a circuit, call the [run](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.PassManager#run) method with a circuit as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A staged pass manager is a special kind of pass manager that represents a level of abstraction above that of a normal pass manager. While a normal pass manager is composed of several transpiler passes, a staged pass manager is composed of several pass managers. This is a useful abstraction because transpilation typically happens in discrete stages, as described in Transpiler stages, with each stage being represented by a pass manager. Staged pass managers are represented by the [StagedPassManager](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/transpile/transpiler-stages) class. \n",

The preset pass managers are instances of StagedPassManager which are used to execute the circuit transformations at the different optimization levels, the pre-defined transpiling pipeline. Here we introduce the functions used generate the entire pass manager by using `generate_preset_pass_manager`\n",

    "The `generate_preset_pass_manager` function has one required positional argument, optimization_level, that controls how much effort the transpiler spends on optimizing circuits. This argument can be an integer taking one of the values 0, 1, 2, or 3. Higher optimization levels generate more optimized circuits at the expense of longer compile times. \n"

    "So far, we've looked at four predefined transpiller pipelines offered by Qiskit using random circuits. One of the key features of Qiskit 1.0 transpiller is to make it easy for users to  custom Passmanager. The easiest way is to configure your own Passmanager by using six standard passes along with the optimization level discussed above, but choosing the option or plug-in for each pass as you like, and another way is to create Passmanager with as many passes as you want by using `StagedPassManager`. In addition, you can create and deploy a new PassManager and implement it in the form of Plugin in Qiskit so that other users can use it.\n",

    "The next stage involves the layout or connectivity of the backend a circuit will be sent to. In general, quantum circuits are abstract entities whose qubits are \"virtual\" or \"logical\" representations of actual qubits used in computations. To execute a sequence of gates, a one-to-one mapping from the \"virtual\" qubits to the \"physical\" qubits in an actual quantum device is necesary. This mapping is stored as a Layout object and is part of the constraints defined within a backend's instruction set architecture (ISA).\n",

Due to the importance of this stage, the preset pass managers try a few different methods to find the best layout. Typically this involves two steps: first, try to find a \"perfect\" layout (a layout that does not require any SWAP operations), and then, a heuristic pass that tries to find the best layout to use if a perfect layout cannot be found. There are two Passes typically used for this first step:\n",

    "- [VF2Layout](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.VF2Layout): This is an AnalysisPass that selects an ideal layout by treating this stage as a subgraph isomorphism problem, solved by the VF2++ algorithm. If more than one layout is found, a scoring heuristic is run to select the mapping with the lowest average error.\n",

    "- [SabreLayout](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.SabreLayout): This pass selects a layout by starting from an initial random layout and repeatedly running the SabreSwap algorithm. This pass is only used in optimization levels 1, 2, and 3 if a perfect layout isn't found via the VF2Layout pass.

    "### 3. Routing Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement a two-qubit gate between qubits that are not directly connected on a quantum device, one or more SWAP gates must be inserted into the circuit to move the qubit states around until they are adjacent on the device gate map. Each SWAP gate represents an expensive and noisy operation to perform. Thus, finding the minimum number of SWAP gates needed to map a circuit onto a given device is an important step in the transpilation process. For efficiency, this stage is typically computed alongside the Layout stage by default, but they are logically distinct from one another. The Layout stage selects the hardware qubits to be used, while the Routing stage inserts the appropriate amount of SWAP gates in order to execute the circuits using the selected layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, finding the optimal SWAP mapping is hard. In fact, it is an NP-hard problem, and is thus prohibitively expensive to compute for all but the smallest quantum devices and input circuits. To work around this, Qiskit uses a stochastic heuristic algorithm called SabreSwap to compute a good, but not necessarily optimal, SWAP mapping. The use of a stochastic method means that the circuits generated are not guaranteed to be the same over repeated runs. Indeed, running the same circuit repeatedly results in a distribution of circuit depths and gate counts at the output. It is for this reason that many users choose to run the routing function (or the entire StagedPassManager) many times and select the lowest-depth circuits from the distribution of outputs."

    "### 4 Translation Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a quantum circuit, you are free to use any quantum gate (unitary operation) that you like, along with a collection of non-gate operations such as qubit measurement or reset instructions. However, most quantum devices only natively support a handful of quantum gate and non-gate operations. These native gates are part of the definition of a target's ISA and this stage of the preset PassManagers translates (or unrolls) the gates specified in a circuit to the native basis gates of a specified backend. This is an important step, as it allows the circuit to be executed by the backend, but typically leads to an increase in the depth and number of gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two special cases are especially important to highlight, and help illustrate what this stage does.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If a SWAP gate is not a native gate to the target backend, this requires three CNOT gates: As a product of three CNOT gates, a SWAP is an expensive operation to perform on noisy quantum devices. However, such operations are usually necessary for embedding a circuit into the limited gate connectivities of many devices. Thus, minimizing the number of SWAP gates in a circuit is a primary goal in the transpilation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A Toffoli, or controlled-controlled-not gate (ccx), is a three-qubit gate. Given that our basis gate set includes only single- and two-qubit gates, this operation must be decomposed. However, it is quite costly: For every Toffoli gate in a quantum circuit, the hardware may execute up to six CNOT gates and a handful of single-qubit gates. This example demonstrates that any algorithm making use of multiple Toffoli gates will end up as a circuit with large depth and will therefore be appreciably affected by noise.\n",

    "## 3. Build your own Pass Managers with Staged Pass Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the powerful feature of qiskit1.0 transpiler is the \"flexibility\". It allows you compose a `PassManager` only has two stages or 3 stages. Also it allows you put your own `Pass` at desired stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make a function that returns `Dynamic Decoupling` Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will try to build a custom `scheduling` pass to perform a `Dynamic Decoupling`, which works by adding pulse sequences (known as dynamical decoupling sequences) to idle qubits to flip them around the Bloch sphere, which cancels the effect of noise channels, thereby suppressing decoherence. These pulse sequences are similar to refocusing pulses used in nuclear magnetic resonance. For a full description, see [A Quantum Engineer's Guide to Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560). For your better understanding, here you can learn by `Nick Bronn` what is the dynamic decoupling - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67jRWQuW3Fk. To finish this part, you many want to take a look at [this official documentation about creading a dynamic decoupling pass](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/transpile/dynamical-decoupling-pass-manager) and [this documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/transpile/dynamical-decoupling-pass-manager).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use same quantum circuit that we've been used before. A dynamical decoupling sequence is a series of gates that compose to the identity and are spaced regularly in time. For example, start by creating a simple sequence called XY4 consisting of four gates."

We know a priori that the YGate has the same duration and error as the XGate, however, so we can just retrieve those properties from the target and add them back for the YGates. This is also why the basis_gates were saved separately, since we are adding the YGate instruction to the target although it is not an actual basis gate of our backend - ibm_torino."
