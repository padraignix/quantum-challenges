    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic Light Emitting Diodes or OLEDs have become increasingly popular in recent years as the basis for fabrication of thin, flexible TV and mobile phone displays that emit light upon application of an electric current. Recent studies ([**Gao et al., 2021**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-021-00540-6)) have been looking at electronic transitions of high energy states in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules, which could be useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for OLED technology. TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency (IQE), i.e the fraction of the charge carriers in a circuit or system that emit absorbed photons, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent. That large boost in efficiency means manufacturers could produce OLEDs for use in devices requiring low-power consumption, such as cell phones, which could in turn lead to future developments where virtually any surface can be converted into a cheap and energy-efficient lighting source covering vast areas of homes, offices, museums and more!\n",

    "### Why quantum?\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers could be invaluable tools for studying the electronic structure and dynamical properties of complex molecules and materials as it makes more sense to model quantum mechanical systems on a quantum device than on a classical computer. A recent joint research project by IBM Quantum and partners was successful in developing methods to improve accuracy for the calculation of excited TADF states for efficient OLEDs, making it the world's first research case of applying quantum computers to the calculation of excited states of commercial materials (see paper linked above for reference). \n",
    "    \n",
    "With this background information, we are interested in describing quantum computations of the “excited states,” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient OLED devices."

    "Qiskit Runtime is a new architecture offered by IBM Quantum that streamlines computations requiring many iterations. These experiments will execute significantly faster within this improved hybrid quantum/classical process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit Runtime allows authorized users to upload their Qiskit quantum programs for themselves or others to use. A Qiskit quantum program, also called a Qiskit Runtime program, is a piece of Python code that takes certain inputs, performs quantum and maybe classical computation, interactively provides intermediate results if desired, and returns the processing results. The same or other authorized users can then invoke these quantum programs by simply passing in the required input parameters.\n",

    "\n",

    "To run the VQE using Qiskit Runtime, we only have to do very few changes from the local VQE run and mainly have to replace the VQE class by the VQEProgram class. Both follow the same MinimumEigensolver interface and thus share the compute_minimum_eigenvalue method to execute the algorithm and return the same type of result object. Merely the signature of the initializer differs sligthly.\n",
