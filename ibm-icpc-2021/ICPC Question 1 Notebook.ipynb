    "Quantum computations are expressed by quantum circuits, which consist of a list of gates, $G_1G_2...G_k$, each being a unitary matrix (a matrix $U$ is called unitary if $U^{-1}\\,{=}\\,U^\\dagger$).  The basic gates include the identity transformation($Id$) that performs no computation, and Pauli matrices : <br>\n",

    "All single-qubit quantum computations $U_1$ can be obtained by multiplyingthe roots of Pauli matrices (also known as Eulerâ€™s angle decomposition. However, to implement quantum transformations spanning multiple qubits, we need gates spanning more than one qubit, otherwise known as entangling gates.  It turns out that it suffices to add a very simple gate, called the $\\text{CNOT}$ and defined as follows,\n",

    "to obtain computational universality in the sense of the ability to express arbitrary transformations as circuits with $U$ and $\\text{CNOT}$ gates.  Both leading quantum computing technologies, superconducting circuits and trapped ions, allow a straightforward physical-level implementation of the above gates in practice. In both technologies, the cost of implementing the $\\text{CNOT}$ gate exceeds that of arbitrary single-qubit $U_1$ gates.  Thus, an efficient quantum computation minimizes the use of the $\\text{CNOT}$ gates\n",

    "A quantum circuit is said to implement an $n$-input $m$-output Boolean function $f(x)$ if it computes the transformation $|x,0,0\\rangle \\mapsto e^{i\\theta(x)}|x,f(x),0\\rangle$ for some arbitrary real-valued function $\\theta(x)$, i.e., first part of the register passes unchanged, the second part accumulates the bit values of the desired function $f(x)$, and the third part, with $S$ qubits, is used as a computational scratch space. When $\\theta(x) \\equiv 2\\pi$, implying $e^{i\\theta(x)} \\equiv 1$, the implementation is called phaseless.  We consider the phase $\\theta(x)$ irrelevant in what follows, which is consistent with measuring the $m$ output bits immediately after implementing the circuit. Allowing the phase to take different values depending on the input introduces a degree of freedom that can be explored to obtain shorter circuits, as there are fewer conditions for the circuit to satisfy.  The total number of qubits spanned by such a circuit is $n\\,{+}\\,m\\,{+}\\,S$.  Note that the $S$-qubit scratch space needs to be returned to value $|0\\rangle$ as otherwise, the implementation may not be used in quantum algorithms due to unwanted entanglement residing on the unreset scratch qubits.\n"
